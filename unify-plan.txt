Three parts:
1) Google vision (involving the camera)
2) Distance (involving the sonic)
3) Color detection (involving the camera)

Setup:
* Initialize the Google client
* Setup the sound process
* Setup GPIO, pins
* Setup the camera: resolution
* Create the image array

The main loop:
* Calculate distance -> change sound volume
* Capture an image -> Calculate color -> new sound process with new frequency
* Every 30 cycles: Capture an image -> process and output the object
* Go to sleep for 100 ms

On exit/interrupted: kill the sound process, release the camera, clean up GPIO
